# Object-Tracking

Object Tracking is broadly divided into three types Point Tracking, Kernel Tracking and Silhouette Tracking in which I had used Kernel Tracking Template based Object Tracking algorithm to build this project

I had used Python for programming and Numpy, Pandas and OpenCV as key Python Libraries to build this project.

Project Domain: Video Surveillance, Computer Vision, Motion Analysis and Machine Learning.

Technology and Concept:

Uses Python3, Numpy, Pandas and OpenCV as core Libraries.
Concepts used are as follows: Blurring, Sharpening, Thresholding Binarization, Dilation Erosion, Edge Detection and Image Gradients, Perspective and Affine Transforms, Color Filtering, Background Subraction, Foreground Subtraction, Optical Flow, Mean-shift and Cam-shift tracking algorithms.


Setup and Installation:

Install python3: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
Install Numpy, Pandas and OpenCV: Type these commands on Command Prompt: pip install numpy pip install pandas for OpenCV : https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases download Source Code zip file.
